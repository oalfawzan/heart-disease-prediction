# Heart Disease Prediction using the Statlog (Heart) Dataset

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the "Statlog (Heart)" dataset to predict heart disease. The project is divided into two phases: the first focuses on data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization, while the second emphasizes predictive modeling, feature selection, and model comparison.

## Project Overview

- **Title**: Heart Disease Prediction using the Statlog (Heart) Dataset
- **Author**: Osama Alfawzan
- **Date**: 2023-06-02

## Repository Contents
